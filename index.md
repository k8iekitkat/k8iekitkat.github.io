## CPSC 120

* Lab 5

    One of my three favorite labs in this CPSC 120 course would be Lab 5 part 1. Through this lab, I have
    learned to code using different operation assingments in order to find the area of a rectangle. In
    doing so, I was able to get familiar with using different functions and files of code. This lab has
    also enhanced my ability to understanding queries and how to incorporate them into my code. 


* Lab 6

    My second favorite of my top three would be Lab 6 part 2. Growing up, I have always been intruiged by 
    card games such as poker and black jack. As I realized that I have a chance to see the foundation of 
    how it can be coded I got excited. This lab not only was a topic of interest but it got be extremely
    familiar with how booleans and if else statements, things I was struggling with in previous to this lab.
