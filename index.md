## CPSC 120

* Lab 5
One of my three favorite labs in this CPSC 120 course would be Lab 5 part 1. Through this lab, I have learned to code using different operation assignments in order
to find the area of a rectangle. In doing so, I was able to get familiar with using different functions and files of code. This lab has also enhanced my ability to 
understand queries and how to incorporate them into my code.

* Lab 6
My second favorite of my top three would be Lab 6 part 2. Growing up, I have always been intrigued by card games such as poker and black jack. As I realized that I
have a chance to see the foundation of how it can be coded I got excited. This lab not only was a topic of interest but it got me extremely familiar with how 
booleans and if else statements, things I was struggling with in previous to this lab.

* Lab 8
My third favorite of my top three would be Lab 8 part 2. I loved the trial and error it took to get my code to solve the average right. This lab also got me familiar
with vectors and how to access the elements inside to use for a particular reason. In this case it was to calculate the average the total of whatever the user inputs.
